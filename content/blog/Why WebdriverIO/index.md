WebdriverIO is a custom implementation for selenium's W3C webdriver API. It is written in Javascript and packaged into 'npm' and runs on Node.js.

### Main Features of WebdriverIO:
- WebdriverIO is a good automation tool which can automate both web applications and native mobile Apps.
- It has integrated test runner which helps us to write asynchronous commands in a synchronous way so that we donâ€™t need to care about how to handle a Promise to avoid racing conditions.
- It has 'wdio setup wizard' which makes our project setup very easy.
- We can write our own javascript functions test.
- The test runner also comes with a variety of hooks that allow us to interfere into the test process in order to e.g. take screenshots if an error occurs or modify the test procedure according to a previous test result.
- WebdriverIO services will be helpful to integrate our test to third party tools like 'Appium'.

### Installation steps:

To install webdriverIO, you will need node to be installed in your system.
